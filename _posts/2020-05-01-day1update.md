#### Roads

Main mall has been extended end-to-end from the Forestry building to the flag pole plaza by the Rose Garden. The layouts for Lower Mall have also been implemented so buildings along side it (including Marine Drive residence, Totem Park residence, Orchid Commons, Ponderosa residence, UBC Building Operations, etc.) may start construction. University Blvd. next to the UBC bookstore has also finished construction (although the totem pole still needs to be worked on).
